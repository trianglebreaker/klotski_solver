$ Each new line is a row of the puzzle, and each unique character represents a block.
$ A line starting with a % marks the start of a new board. Boards continue until another %, or the end of the file.
$ The first board is always the start board, and the second is always the goal board. Others are ignored.
$ Spaces and empty lines are ignored; the "." character represents a space in the puzzle that blocks can move through.
$ Lines starting with a $ are comments, and are ignored.
