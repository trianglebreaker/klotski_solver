$ Each new line is a row of the puzzle, and each unique character represents a block
$ Lines starting with a $ are comments, and are ignored
$ Lines starting with % mark the start of a board; the board continues until another % line or EOF
$ The first board is always the start board, and the second is always the goal board. Others are ignored
$ The goal board only needs to show where goal pieces need to go
$ Spaces and empty lines are ignored; the "." character represents a space in the puzzle that blocks can move through
