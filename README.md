# klotski_solver
Solver for Klotski-like sliding block puzzles.

## Why?
I've been playing the Professor Layton games quite a bit recently; if you've played them before, I'm sure you know what this is all about. Sliding block puzzles are the hardest challenges those games have to offer, and I can count the ones I've actually solved without a guide on one hand. Naturally, the solution is to ~~meet the puzzles directly~~ make a computer do the thinking for me.

## Features
- Customizable board configuration; solves more than the classic puzzle ("Queen's Escape" from *Curious Village*)
- Support for irregularly shaped boards and pieces ("The Diabolical Box" from *Diabolical/Pandora's Box*)
- Support for multiple goal pieces ("The Time Machine" from *Unwound/Lost Future*)
- Writes the step-by-step solution to a file

The three puzzles mentioned above are included in the `examples` folder to show you how to format your own puzzles.

## Usage Example
(with verbose output turned on in the code)
```
$ python3 main.py ./examples/queens_escape.txt

```

## Todo
- Optimize this further if possible; it's not very fast. My tests showed the program took 5 seconds to solve "Queen's Escape", 75 seconds to solve "The Diabolical Box", and is not going to solve "The Time Machine" anytime soon (I gave up after 10 minutes).
  - Granted, puzzles like "The Diabolical Box" and "The Time Machine" don't benefit much from trimming move paths because every piece shape is unique. Worse, the latter quickly suffers from Exploding Treeâ„¢; it broke the 100000-path mark 22 moves in, and as of the 25th move there were nearly 400000 possibilities.
- Add support for moving multiple pieces at once under certain circumstances (this would allow it to solve "Touch Stone" from *Last Specter/Spectre's Call*, albeit with a slightly incorrect move count)

## Thanks
Credit goes to this article for giving me the push I needed to actually try this. I decided to use Python instead of Scala as the author did here (and took the chance to brush up on it), but much of the same concepts apply.
