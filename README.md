# klotski_solver
Solver for Klotski-like sliding block puzzles.

## Why?
I've been playing the Professor Layton games quite a bit recently; if you've played them before, I'm sure you know what this is all about. Sliding block puzzles are the hardest challenges those games have to offer, and I can count the ones I've actually solved without a guide on one hand. Naturally, the solution is to ~~meet the puzzles directly~~ make a computer do the thinking for me.

## Features
- Customizable board configuration; solves more than the classic puzzle ("Queen's Escape" from *Curious Village*)
- Support for irregularly shaped boards and pieces ("The Diabolical Box" from *Diabolical/Pandora's Box*)
- Support for multiple goal pieces ("The Time Machine" from *Unwound/Lost Future*)
- Writes the step-by-step solution to a file

There's no fancy menu or command argument to load in custom puzzles right now. You'll have to edit main.py to switch the puzzle that the solver will solve. The three puzzles mentioned above are included as examples to show you how to format your own puzzles.

## Usage Examples
